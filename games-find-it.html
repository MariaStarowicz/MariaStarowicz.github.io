									<h2>find it</h2>
									<br>
									<p>this 3D game was created by a group of 4 students to complete a game development course at our university.
										'find it' is a 3D escape room game from a first person perspective. 
										the action of the game takes place during Halloween night. 
										the player takes on the role of a high school student from a wizarding family, 
										whose grandmother recently died, and her last wish was that her inheritance be given to 
										a person who would enter the heart of her enchanted house where she lived. 
										the player receives a letter invitation to try his hand at the hidden treasure on Halloween night. 
										the main task of the game is to solve puzzles in order to get to the last room of the building and find the prize. 
										on each level the player can also find special collectibles, and for collecting all of them, he gets access to a bonus level.

									<p>many of the objects in the game were downloaded from places offering free game resources, including the unity store.
										each member of the group was involved in level design, creating logic puzzles and gameplay programming. 
										as the project manager, I was responsible for organizing our work and meetings, overseeing project development and deadlines, 
										as well as helping other team members when they encountered any problem. 
										I was also responsible for handling music and sounds, saving game progress data, 
										defining the game and game menu logic, as well as programming smaller scripts and creating some graphic assets in blender</p>
